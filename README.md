    “If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: <span><strong>SET A BUDGET.</strong></span> If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!”</p></div>

      <p id="overalls-trend">The Overalls Trend: Setting trends can be difficult. A brand new trend has to be very unique and interesting, and will only catch on if others see it and like it. Setting a trend involves taking risks and being unconventional, but it’s rewarding to see others appreciating and copying your style. With a little bit of creativity and some work, you can start your own trend.

    “Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”</p>
  <p id="color-blush">When you think of fall, you likely think of colorful leaves falling from the trees, lowering temperatures, and cozy sweaters. When you’re selecting your fall makeup colors, keep these images in mind. Fall makeup is all about warmth and dimension. It’s about deep, rich colors, similar to the colors of the leaves. As you finish stashing your sundresses and bikinis for the year, it’s time to bring out some warm makeup along with your warmer clothes.</p>
